# Windows Store Apps Assets Template PSD

This is a simple to use template for designing assets for Windows 8 store apps. All assets required for submitting your app to the store is included, some optional ones are even there.

## How to use

1. Design your logo/badge/asset inside each layer.
2. Hide the “Theme color” layer. (Most assets shouldn’t have backgrounds)
3. Use *Save for Web & Devices* (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S). Ignore the warning and press *Yes*.
4. Click *Save*.
5. Make sure the following is selected:
   - *Format*: **Images Only**
   - *Settings*: Default Settings
   - *Slices*: **All User Slices**
6. Click *Save*. All images will be saved in an images subfolder of the folder you selected.
7. Naming conventions match up with what VS2012 expects. Simply drop the files into your *Assets* folder. If you have previous assets without scale information, delete them first.
